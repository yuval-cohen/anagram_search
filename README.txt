Anagram Search:

A program in C++ that finds anagrams of a given phrase from a word list file (such as .\word.list).

e.g.
anagram_search.exe word.list real fun

Anagram is produced by rearranging the letters of a word or a phrase to produce another word or phrase, e.g.:
"funeral" and "real fun"
"forty five" and "over fifty"
